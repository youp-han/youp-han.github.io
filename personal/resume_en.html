### Professional Experience

**Freelance Sr. Consultant / Engineer (JJST)** | Seoul, KR | 2016 – 2025
*Provided software engineering and DevOps consulting for various enterprise clients.*

**Client: Eland Innople** | (2018.07 – 2025.04)
*Supported the Application Architecture team by developing key systems and improving automation processes.*

*   **Developed and later optimized a User Integration API** using Spring Boot &amp; JPA to centralize user data. When an 8X user base expansion caused performance issues, I refactored the API, implementing a new Full vs. Partial data sync strategy designed by the AA team, which significantly reduced the lengthy full-synchronization time.
*   **Developed a data migration program** with automated error-checking and retry logic to transfer large datasets (up to 17TB per brand) from legacy SMB servers to AWS S3.
*   **Managed and improved the CI/CD environment**, which included separating the Jenkins infrastructure by service to resolve build bottlenecks and implementing CI/CD configurations as Pipeline-as-Code (Groovy).
*   **Developed a VPN User Management System** using ASP.NET MVC. By redesigning the sync logic from a full-rewrite to a delta-based update, **sync time for 2,000 users was reduced from over 30 minutes to under 15 seconds**.

**Client: British American Tobacco (BAT)** | (2016.04 – 2018.02)
*Acted as a Project and Test Lead for sales system modernization projects.*

*   **Led the porting of a legacy C++ POS application** to a modern Android platform, which involved analyzing the undocumented system to define its functions and redesigning the UX.
*   **Served as Test Lead for the migration of the core sales system to AWS**, creating the end-to-end test strategy and coordinating with international teams.

**Content Development Team Lead** | Ncer, co. Ltd | 2012.10 – 2013.11
*Led a team creating cross-platform educational apps (iOS/Android) using Cocos2d-x and C++ for CJ Entertainment, one of which won a **2013 Parents' Choice Gold Award**.*

**POS System Admin/Developer** | Kirainfosys Inc. | 2007.06 – 2010.06
*Client: Eland Systems*
*   Maintained and developed features for the POS system for Eland’s jewelry brands (Lloyd, Clue, OST) using ASP, Visual Basic 6.0, and MS SQL.
*   Took full ownership of development from an offshore team to resolve communication issues and delivery delays, ensuring timely updates for over 200 stores.

### Education

**Master of Information Technology (Extended)** | 2014.02 – 2015.12
University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) – Sydney, AU
*   **Thesis: Efficient Adoption Practice of DevOps**
    *   A systematic literature review that analyzed over 3,700 papers to synthesize best practices for adopting DevOps in established information systems.

**Bachelor of Science, Computer Information Systems** | 2004.05 – 2006.12
Western Michigan University – Kalamazoo, MI, USA
